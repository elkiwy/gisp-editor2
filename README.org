#+TITLE: Gisp-Editor2

This is an early draft for a mini IDE around my programming language Gisp (A Lisp dialect focussed on creating procedural images and animations).

I already made a Gisp Editor, but that was made with ClojureScruipt and Electron, and I didn't really liked that idea. At the time I just wanted something that I could made quickly and focus on the language itself.

Now I want to make it more personal and lightweight, so I'm building this with pure C and SDL and nothing else. It will be a long way, but fun and interesting nonetheless.
